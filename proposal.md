The city has three universities, NYU, Columbia, and CUNY, between them having over 360 thousand students. Additionally, the city has an strong presence in data science-related industries, particularly finance and healthcare.

NYC has three airports close by, two of which are international: John F. Kennedy International Airport, Newark Liberty International Airport, and LaGuardia Airport. The city's position on the East coast allows for relatively easy attendance from Europe and Africa.
